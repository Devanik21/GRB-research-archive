# GRB-research-archive


## Overview

This project implements an advanced **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** neural network for reconstructing X-ray afterglow light curves from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). The system connects directly to the **Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory** archive, retrieves real-time observational data, and uses deep learning to reconstruct high-resolution temporal profiles of these cosmic explosions.

### What are Gamma-Ray Bursts?

Gamma-Ray Bursts are the most energetic explosions in the universe since the Big Bang. They release more energy in seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime. Understanding their light curves helps astronomers study:
- The death of massive stars (supernovae)
- Neutron star collisions
- Black hole formation
- The early universe and cosmic evolution

## Key Features

### 1. Live Data Integration
- **Direct API Connection**: Fetches real-time data from the UK Swift Science Data Centre (UKSSDC)
- **Automatic Parsing**: Handles NASA's QDP (Quick and Dandy Plotter) scientific data format
- **12 Famous GRBs**: Pre-configured catalog including historic bursts like:
  - GRB 130427A (Monster Burst - Record Energy)
  - GRB 080319B (Visible to Naked Eye from 7.5 billion light-years)
  - GRB 090423 (Most Distant at z=8.2)
  - GRB 190114C (First TeV Gamma-Ray Detection)

### 2. Adaptive Neural Architecture
The system intelligently adjusts its neural network depth based on data availability:
- **Lightweight Mode** (< 80 data points): 2-layer BiLSTM, optimized for sparse datasets
- **Standard Mode** (80-300 points): 3-layer BiLSTM, balanced performance
- **Deep Learning Mode** (> 300 points): 4-layer BiLSTM, maximum reconstruction fidelity

### 3. Manual Control Suite
Advanced users can override automatic settings:
- **Architecture Selection**: Choose Lightweight, Standard, Deep, or Custom configurations
- **Layer Customization**: Define number of layers (2-5) and units per layer (16-256)
- **Training Parameters**: 
  - Learning rate adjustment (0.0001 - 0.01)
  - Epoch control (10-300 epochs)
  - Batch size tuning (1-16)
- **Dropout Regularization**: Optional overfitting prevention
- **Resolution Control**: Adjustable reconstruction smoothness (1x-5x)

### 4. Advanced Visualization
- Log-log scale plotting optimized for power-law decay physics
- Error bar visualization with proper propagation
- Optional 95% confidence interval bands
- Interactive training loss evolution plots
- Professional publication-ready graphics

### 5. Comprehensive Data Export
Export reconstructed light curves in both:
- **Logarithmic scale**: log(time), log(flux)
- **Linear scale**: time (seconds), flux (erg/cm²/s)
- CSV format with descriptive filenames

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture: Bidirectional LSTM

**Why BiLSTM?**
- GRB light curves exhibit complex temporal dependencies
- Bidirectional processing captures both early-time rise and late-time decay
- LSTM cells handle long-term dependencies in sparse, irregular data
- Recurrent architecture naturally suited for time-series reconstruction

**Network Design:**
```
Input: Log-transformed time points
    ↓
Bidirectional LSTM Layers (adaptive depth)
    ↓
Dense Output Layer (linear activation)
    ↓
Output: Reconstructed log-flux values
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Fetch**: HTTP GET request to Swift-XRT archive
2. **Parse**: Extract time, flux, and error columns from QDP format
3. **Filter**: Remove negative/zero flux values and trigger artifacts (t < 10s)
4. **Transform**: Log₁₀ transformation for both time and flux
5. **Scale**: MinMax normalization to [0,1] range
6. **Reshape**: Convert to LSTM-compatible 3D tensors (samples, timesteps, features)
7. **Train**: Adam optimizer with MSE loss function
8. **Reconstruct**: Generate smooth interpolated light curve
9. **Inverse Transform**: Convert back to physical units

### Mathematical Foundation

GRB light curves follow power-law decay:
```
F(t) ∝ t^(-α)
```

In log-space this becomes linear:
```
log(F) = -α·log(t) + const
```

The BiLSTM learns this underlying physics plus:
- Plateau phases
- Flares and rebrightening events
- Jet break features
- Multi-component decay
